BON
===

This repository contains snapshots of several BON-related development tools.

 * **bonc** is a parser and typechecker for the textual Business Object Notation (BON).
 * **BON_IDE** is an experimental Eclipse plugin for editing graphical BON.
 * **beetlz** is a refinement checker, architecture extraction, and specification generator to/from BON and JML-annotated Java.
 * **grammars** contains experiments in supporting type-logical grammar based parsing of informal BON specs.
 * **semantic_properties_plugin** is an experimental plugin for support user-defined syntactic and semantic extensions of the BON parser (it is the prototype for the "E" in EBON).
 * **iBONText** is an experimental Eclipse plugin supporting refinement to/from informal textual BON and Java.
